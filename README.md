# Fake-News-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to detect whether a news article is Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. It uses a labeled dataset of news headlines and text and classifies them using algorithms like PassiveAggressiveClassifier or Logistic Regression. The text data is vectorized using TF-IDF before training the model.
